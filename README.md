# js-countdown
A simple countdown that shows how many days, hours, minutes and seconds are left until the beginning of the new year.

From the script.js file, you can change the date for which the remaining time is calculated, changing: **const endDate = '31 Dec 2021 ';**  with the period you want.
For the background you can change the name of the picture in the style.css file: **background-image: url (./ images / timesquare.jpg);**
